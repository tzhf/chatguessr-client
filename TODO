TODOS:

	☐ Bigger font on the main page. For example `Using a secondary bot account...` is hard to read
		-> slightly adjusted, but very slightly :p
	☐ Live Streamers >> Server unreachable. 
		(Are you using some .env? If so that should be moved to the backend API)
		Unless NUXT is server rendered?
		-> it works here, the BASE_URL in the .env should match: https://chatguessr-client.now.sh, but you also can change it in Vercel environment variables
	✓ Make link to GeoGuessr target _blank?
	✓ Make link to Donate target _blank?
	☐ Add the "automated" map to client (What route?) /automap?
		-> is it fixed ? last time sessions only lasted few hours
	☐ Add link to the map page on the home page
	✓ Handle a way to redirect traffic comming to `https://chatguessr.com/?bot=<bot_name>` To send it to the map page
		-> bot param is no longer necessary e.g: https://chatguessr.com/map/streamer
