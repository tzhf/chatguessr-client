TODOS:

	☐ Bigger font on the main page. For example `Using a secondary bot account...` is hard to read
	☐ Live Streamers >> Server unreachable. 
		(Are you using some .env? If so that should be moved to the backend API)
		Unless NUXT is server rendered?
	☐ Make link to GeoGuessr target _blank?
	☐ Make link to Donate target _blank?
	☐ Add the "automated" map to client (What route?) /automap?
	☐ Add link to the map page on the home page
	☐ Handle a way to redirect traffic comming to `https://chatguessr.com/?bot=<bot_name>` To send it to the map page
